          This is the chained build that glues together the output from the
          BUILDER_IMAGE with the RUNTIME_IMAGE. The result is a new image based
          on RUNTIME_IMAGE (that serves static content via Nginx) but with the
          output from BUILDER_IMAGE (i.e. the compiled frontend code).
