      This template defines resources needed to serve static content via Nginx
      HTTP Server and a reverse proxy (nginx). This is your runtime image that
      serves the compiled Angular frontend SPA (Single Page Application) to the
      outside world. Nginx is a web server and a reverse proxy server, with a
      strong focus on high concurrency, performance and low memory usage.
